<p><br></p>

<p>This guide describes the requirements and procedure for installing the LunarG Vulkan SDK for Windows.  It also includes compilation and runtime instructions for demo Vulkan applications.  Refer to the LunarG Vulkan SDK, Documentation and Known Issues at <a href="https://Vulkan.LunarG.com" TARGET="_blank" title="LunarXchange">Vulkan.LunarG.com</a> for the most up to date SDK information.</p>

<p>The Vulkan API is a low overhead, explicit, cross-platform graphics API that provides applications with direct control over the GPU, maximizing application performance.  For more information on the Vulkan specification and API, refer to <a href="https://khronos.org/registry/vulkan" TARGET="_blank" title="Khronos Vulkan website">Khronos.org</a>.
For tutorial-level information, refer to LunarG's Vulkan tutorial, which can be found in the SDK in the
<code>Documentation\Tutorial</code> directory and on the <a href="https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/windows/tutorial/html/index.html" TARGET="_blank">LunarXchange website</a>.</p>

<p>The LunarG Vulkan SDK provides the development and runtime components required to build, run, and debug Vulkan applications.  This SDK is based on the Khronos Vulkan API header, whose version is reflected in the Vulkan SDK version number (for example, SDK version 1.0.21.0 indicates that the SDK uses Vulkan header revision 1.0.21).  The SDK also includes certain Vulkan extensions for window system integration and debug extensions (refer to the release notes for further details).</p>

<p>This SDK does NOT include a Vulkan driver.  Please contact your GPU hardware vendor for a Vulkan Installable Client Driver (ICD).  This SDK will allow you to build Vulkan applications but you will need a Vulkan driver (ICD) to execute them.</p>

<a id="user-content-system-requirements" class="anchor" href="#user-content-system-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System Requirements</h2>

<p>Vulkan development using the LunarG Vulkan SDK requires a Windows development system to meet specific hardware and software requirements. These specifications are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or 10 (64-bit)

<ul>
<li>Files for Windows 32-bit support are in the SDK, but 32-bit functionality has not been tested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Graphics card and ICD that support Vulkan.  Contact your graphics hardware supplier for information on Vulkan support.</li>
<li>8 GB memory</li>
<li>Sufficient free disk space to install the Vulkan SDK (approximately 300 MB)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, to build the samples and demos, one must install the following programs:</p>

<ul>
<li>CMake 3.0 or newer (samples only)</li>
<li>Python 3.0 or newer (samples only)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2013 Update 4, or newer</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-download-the-sdk" class="anchor" href="#user-content-download-the-sdk" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Download the SDK</h2>

<p>Download the LunarG Vulkan SDK from  <a href="https://Vulkan.LunarG.com" TARGET="_blank" title="LunarXchange">Vulkan.LunarG.com</a> by clicking on the 'Download Vulkan Tools for Windows' button.  The SDK download file is named <code>VulkanSDK-</code><em><code>version</code></em><code>-Installer.exe</code>.  Make note of the directory to which the file was downloaded.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-install-the-sdk" class="anchor" href="#user-content-install-the-sdk" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install the SDK</h2>

<p>The LunarG Vulkan SDK For Windows is a self-extracting installer.  Run the downloaded <code>.exe</code> file to install the SDK. The default SDK install location is <code>C:\VulkanSDK\</code><em><code>version</code></em>.</p>

<p>Installing the LunarG Vulkan SDK sets the system environment variable <code>VULKAN_SDK</code> to the directory in which the SDK is installed, which will look like <code>C:\VulkanSDK\1.0.0.0</code>, but with the version number being the version that was installed.  Installing the LunarG Vulkan SDK also prepends <code>%VULKAN_SDK%\Bin</code> (<code>%VULKAN_SDK%\Bin32</code> on 32-bit Windows)  to the system <code>PATH</code> environment variable.  The system environment variable <code>VK_SDK_PATH</code> is set to the same value as <code>VULKAN_SDK</code> for compatibility with prior releases.  Note that programs and command shells that were running during installation may not see the updated environment variables until they are restarted.</p>

<p>The Vulkan loader, <code>vulkan-1.dll</code>, is installed in <code>C:\Windows\System32</code>.  This will be a 32-bit DLL on 32-bit Windows targets and a 64-bit DLL on 64-bit Windows targets.  64-bit targets will also have the 32-bit Vulkan loader (of the same name) installed in <code>C:\Windows\SysWOW64</code>.  Vulkan applications will find and use the appropriate library by default.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-sdk-contents" class="anchor" href="#user-content-sdk-contents" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SDK Contents</h2>

<p>The LunarG Vulkan SDK provides the development and runtime components to create, trace, and replay Vulkan applications.  The SDK also includes the runtime components to load and run Vulkan Application Validation and Debug Layers. The SDK installation process installs contents as described in the table below.  Paths are relative to the directory in which the SDK is installed.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To aid in debugging, the SDK includes PDB files for the Vulkan loader. The PDB files for the loader shipped in the Vulkan runtime are located in <code>Lib</code> (64-bit) and <code>Lib32</code> (32-bit). These PDB files correspond to <code>vulkan-1.dll</code>, found in <code>System32</code> and <code>SysWOW64</code>. These PDB files should not be confused with the PDB files for the debug build, which are located in <code>Source\loader</code>.</p>

<a id="user-content-verify-the-installation" class="anchor" href="#user-content-verify-the-installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Verify the Installation</h2>

<p>Verify the installation of the LunarG Vulkan SDK by running a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run LunarG's Vulkan Installation Analyzer (VIA) to determine if it believes everything can execute properly.

<ul>
<li>VIA can be found as a shortcut under the Start Menu</li>
<li><code>Start Menu-&gt;Vulkan SDK &lt;version&gt;-&gt;via</code></li>
<li>More information on VIA can be found in the VIA.html doc found in this SDK's Documentation section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run a demo Vulkan application like <code>vulkaninfo</code>

<ul>
<li>VulkanInfo can be found as a shortcut under the Start Menu</li>
<li><code>Start Menu-&gt;Vulkan SDK &lt;version&gt;-&gt;vulkaninfo</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><code>vulkaninfo</code> is a program provided in the SDK that outputs various types of Vulkan information such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>device properties of identified GPUs</li>
<li>Vulkan extensions supported by each GPU</li>
<li>recognized layers</li>
<li>supported image formats and format properties</li>
</ul>

<p>Sample <code>vulkaninfo</code> output follows:</p>

<pre><code>Instance Extensions     count = 2
        DEBUG_REPORT                    : extension revision  1

<p>You can also run the cube demo program by selecting the program in <code>Start Menu-&gt;Vulkan SDK &lt;version&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-build-the-demo-programs" class="anchor" href="#user-content-build-the-demo-programs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build the Demo Programs</h2>

<p>The LunarG Vulkan SDK includes the source for two demo applications: <code>vulkaninfo</code> and <code>cube</code>. There are two versions of the cube example: one written in C using vulkan.h, and another written in C++11 using vulkan.hpp. The vulkan.hpp header file is a low-level C++11 API for Vulkan.</p>

<p>The Vulkan demo applications use Microsoft Visual Studio solution files.  To build the demo programs, open the <code>&lt;InstallPath&gt;\Demos\DEMOS.sln</code> file.  This will launch Microsoft Visual Studio, opening the solution with a default build configuration of Debug/Win32. Select the desired build configuration (i.e., Debug/x64).  Building the solution will build all of the demo applications. It is now possible to run each of the applications using the Visual Studio debugger, and to step through their source code including the loader library source and the source of any layer libraries you have enabled.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-trace-and-replay" class="anchor" href="#user-content-trace-and-replay" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Trace and Replay</h2>

<p>The LunarG Vulkan SDK supports tracing and replaying Vulkan applications.  Refer to the <a href="./trace_tools.html">Vulkan Trace and Replay Tools</a> guide for detailed information on Vulkan trace and replay.</p>

<ol>
<li>Build the demo programs as described in the <code>Build the Demos Programs</code> section above.</li>
<li>
<p>Trace the <code>cube</code> demo program by running the following commands from a command prompt:</p>

<pre><code>cd C:\VulkanSDK\&lt;Version&gt;\Demos\x64\Debug
vktrace -p cube.exe -o cube_trace.vktrace
</code></pre>

<p>Close the program after a few seconds, using the window's close button.  Do not stop the program by using <code>ctrl+c</code> as doing so may result in a courrupted trace file.  Notice the trace options used in the command above.</p>

<p><code>-p, --Program &lt;string&gt;</code> — name of the program to trace<br>
<code>-o, --OutputTrace &lt;string&gt;</code> — name of the generated trace file — this must have an extension of '.vktrace'.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>The generated trace file, <code>cube_trace.vktrace</code>, is created in the current directory.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Replay the cube trace file you just generated:</p>

<pre><code>vkreplay -o cube_trace.vktrace -l 2
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the options used in the command above.</p>

<p><code>-o, --Open &lt;string&gt;</code> — name of trace file to replay<br>
<code>-l, --NumLoops &lt;uint&gt;</code> — number of times to replay the trace  </p>

<p>The <code>-l 2</code> option replays the trace twice.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<a id="user-content-enable-validation-layers" class="anchor" href="#user-content-enable-validation-layers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Enable Validation Layers</h2>

<p>The LunarG Vulkan SDK includes runtime support for Debugging and Validation Layers.  These layers can be enabled for an application run or a trace replay by setting the <code>VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS</code> environment variable to a semi-colon-separated list of layer or extension names, as found in the layer manifest files.  Refer to the <a href="./layers.html">Vulkan Validation and Debugging Layers</a> document for more information on layer manifest files.</p>

<p>The LunarG Vulkan SDK includes the following layers:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Layer Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_unique_objects</td>
<td>Alias all Vulkan objects with a unique handle at create time. This is used during validation to ensure that duplicate object handles are correctly tracked.  Note that for optimal efficiency, this layer must be last in the chain (closest to the display driver)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_api_dump</td>
<td>Print API calls and their parameters and values</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation</td>
<td>Print and validate the descriptor set, pipeline state, and dynamic state; validate the interfaces between SPIR-V modules and the graphics pipeline; track and validate GPU memory and its binding to objects and command buffers; validate texture formats and render target formats</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_object_tracker</td>
<td>Print object create/use/destroy, tracking objects by category</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_parameter_validation</td>
<td>Validate API parameters</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_swapchain</td>
<td>Validate the use of the WSI "swapchain" extensions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_threading</td>
<td>Check validity of multi-threaded API usage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_monitor</td>
<td>Monitor the framerate of a program</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In addition to these layers, there is a built-in meta-layer definition which will load a standard set of validation layers in the optimal order:</p>

<pre><code>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation
</code></pre>

<p>Loading this layer definition is equivalent to specifying the following layers in this order:</p>

<ul>
<li>VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_threading</li>
<li>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_parameter_validation</li>
<li>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_object_tracker</li>
<li>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation</li>
<li>VK_LAYER_LUNARG_swapchain</li>
<li>VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_unique_objects</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to the <a href="./layers.html">Vulkan Validation and Debugging Layers</a> documentation for detailed information on layers.</p>

<p>As an example, you can turn on the api_dump layer to examine the Vulkan API calls from an application.  The VK_LAYER_LUNARG_api_dump layer is a debug layer which will print API calls, parameters, and values.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Explicitly activate VK_LAYER_LUNARG_api_dump by setting Windows environment variables as shown below.  You'll use this layer with an application that was built in a previous section.</p>

<pre><code>set VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_api_dump
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the <code>cube</code> program:</p>

<pre><code>cd C:\VulkanSDK\&lt;Version&gt;\Demos\x64\Debug
.\cube &gt; api_dump.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you must redirect the output to a file (as cube.exe is not a console application).  Stop the program after a few seconds and examine the file to see the api_dump layer output. The VK_LAYER_LUNARG_api_dump debug layer will print API calls, parameters, and values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deactivate the explicit layer just enabled.</p>

<pre><code>set VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The Vulkan SDK includes Visual Studio templates so that a programmer can easy create a Vulkan project, without setting up include paths and libraries. The templates are located in SDK install directory, in a subdirectory called "Templates". In order to make these templates appear in Visual Studio, they must be copied into the directory where Visual Studio searches for C++ templates. By default, this is located at:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\username\Documents\Visual Studio 201x\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C++ Project
</code></pre>

<p>The Vulkan SDK includes separate templates for Visual Studio 2013 and 2015. The templates can be enabled by copying the zip files from the SDK template directory into the Visual Studio path given above. Note that it is possible to point Visual Studio at the templates in the SDK, without any copying, but doing so means that any additional templates would have to be put into the Vulkan SDK installation. As a result, copying the files is the recommended approach.</p>

<p>Once you have copied the templates, you can now create a new project or solution from these templates. Open the project creation dialog by going to <code>File -&gt; New -&gt; Project</code>. On the left bar select <code>Templates -&gt; Visual C++</code>. Now, in the center you should see a list of the built-in templates, and at the bottom should be the Vulkan templates. The included templates are described below:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Vulkan Program</td>
<td>A simple Vulkan program with no dependencies, except the Vulkan loader and validation layers. This program creates and then destroys a simple Vulkan instance using the C Vulkan API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vulkan Windowed Program</td>
<td>A Vulkan program that depends upon SDL and GLM. This program creates a blank window, initializes a Vulkan surface on that window, and then waits for the user to close the window. This template uses the C Vulkan API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vulkan C++ Program</td>
<td>A simple Vulkan program with no dependencies, except the Vulkan loader and validation layers. This program creates and then destroys a simple Vulkan instance using the C++ Vulkan API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vulkan C++ Windowed Program</td>
<td>A Vulkan program that depends on SDL and GLM. This program creates a blank window, initializes a Vulkan surface on that window, and then waits for the user to close the window. This template uses the C++ Vulkan API.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Choose "Vulkan Windowed Program", enter a name for your project, and click OK. You should see a new solution and project open in Visual Studio. Build and run the project. When you run the project, you should see a blank window pop up, and when you close the window the program should exit with code 0. Now, change the configuration to x64, build, and run the project again. You should see the same results, but now with a 64-bit build.</p>

<p>You should take some time to examine the source code in this project. The project enables validation layers if the project is built in a debug mode. This project is creating a Vulkan surface on the window, but does not render anything to the screen.</p>

<p>You now have a working Vulkan project. Feel free to use this as a base for larger projects. For additional information on using Vulkan, be sure to go through the LunarG Vulkan samples, or find the many samples available online.</p>
